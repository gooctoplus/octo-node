# Refactoring Plan for Removal of commentActions.js

Given the decision to remove `src/redux/actions/commentActions.js`, a review was conducted to determine if any refactoring or alternative implementations were required. 

## Findings
- No refactoring is necessary as no dependencies were found.
- No alternative implementations are needed as the functionality provided by `commentActions.js` is no longer required by the project specifications.

## Conclusion
The application's functionality remains intact without `commentActions.js`, and no further action is needed beyond its deletion.
